# Transcription Factor Binding Analysis

This code scans regulatory DNA sequences to determine potential binding sites of transcription factors. To determine binding affinity, the position frequency or weight matrix of the transcription factor is used. These matrices allow the code to produce a "binding score" for any given sequence of DNA with a higher binding score corresponding to higher putative affinity. The top binding scores – those above a certain percentage of the maximum binding score - are then presented in a graph, displayed within the DNA sequence, and printed alongside their percentage of the maximum binding score. The repository contains two jupyter notebook files: "gstd1_thor" contains the code and output relevant to the paper, and "template_code" provides a user freindly version of the code which allows the input of all perameters without modifying the script itself.
