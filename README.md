# Transcription Factor Binding Analysis

This code scans regulatory DNA sequences to determine potential transcription factors binding sites. To determine binding affinity, the position frequency or weight matrix of the transcription factor is used. These matrices allow the code to produce a "binding score" for any given sequence of DNA, with a higher binding score corresponding to higher putative affinity. The top binding scores – those above a certain percentage of the maximum binding score - are presented by the code in a graph, displayed within the DNA sequence, and printed alongside their percentage of the maximum binding score. 

The repository contains two py files: "gstd1_thor.py" contains the code specifically relavent to the paper, and "template_code.py" provides a user freindly version of the code which allows the input of all perameters without modifying the script itself. The csv file "gstd1_thor.csv" contains the sequences which the gstd1_thor code scans, and the pdf "gstd1_thor_output.pdf" contains the output generated when when "gstd1_thor.py" is run.
